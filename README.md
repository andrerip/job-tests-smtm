Create a backend API for users to manage products for an online store (think a Shopify/e-commerce catalog). 

Using the API, users should be able to: 
- Retrieve a collection of products
- Users can optionally retrieve a collection of products sorted by title or date created 
- Add a new product to their inventory (product title, SKU, images etc.)
- Group products together by category or tags
